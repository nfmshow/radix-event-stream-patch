//! Contains canonical models for ledger events and transactions.
//! These models are used by the [`TransactionStream`][crate::stream::TransactionStream]
//! and [`TransactionStreamProcessor`][crate::processor::TransactionStreamProcessor]
//! to abstract the source of transactions and events.
//!
//! When implementing a new transaction stream, you will typically
//! convert the native representations of events and transactions
//! into these generic models.
